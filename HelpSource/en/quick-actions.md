- Tap each shortcut link and import it in Shortcuts.

## Add Expense From Tap To Pay
- Open Shortcuts > Automation.
- Tap New Automation.
- Scroll down and select Wallet.
- Configure this screen to your liking. You can choose which card or cards should trigger the automation. It is recommended to leave all categories selected. Instead of Run After Confirmation, choose Run Immediately for an uninterrupted experience.
- On the next screen, tap Create New Shortcut.
- Add action: Get Text from Shortcut Input.

- In Run Shortcut, tap the blue Shortcut field and select Add Expense From Tap To Pay.
- Save the automation.

## Add Income From An SMS Message
- Open Shortcuts > Automation.
- Tap New Automation.
- Scroll down and select Message.
- Configure this screen to your liking. For example, use Message Contains and type the exact phrasing your bank uses in deposit notifications. Instead of Run After Confirmation, choose Run Immediately for an uninterrupted experience.

## Add Income From An Email
- Open Shortcuts > Automation.
- Tap New Automation.
- Scroll down and select Email.
- Configure this screen to your liking. For example, use Subject Contains and type the exact phrasing your bank uses in deposit email subject lines. Instead of Run After Confirmation, choose Run Immediately for an uninterrupted experience.
- On the next screen, tap Create New Shortcut.

- Add action: Run Shortcut.

## Troubleshooting
- If a shared item imports with a long autogenerated name, rename the shortcut after import.
- If you do not see the expected trigger type, make sure your device and iOS version support that trigger.
- If the last Offshore action appears missing, confirm Offshore is installed on that device, then edit the shortcut and add Offshore Add Income or Add Expense as the last action again.
- If an automation does not fire, open it in Shortcuts and verify trigger condition text, selected Run Shortcut action, and run behavior settings.
