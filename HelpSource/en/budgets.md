Inside a budget, you track expenses in two lanes:
- Planned: recurring or expected costs.
- Variable: one-off spending from your cards.
- Categories: long-press a category and assign a spending cap for this budgeting period.

## How Budget Totals Are Calculated

These totals are shown in the budget header.
- Planned Income = planned income total in this period.
- Actual Income = actual income total in this period.
- Planned Total = sum of planned expense planned amounts.
- Variable Total = sum of variable expenses in the period.
- Unified Total = planned effective total + variable total.
- Max Savings = planned income - planned expenses effective total.
- Projected Savings = planned income - planned expenses planned total.
- Actual Savings = actual income - (planned expenses effective total + variable expenses total).
