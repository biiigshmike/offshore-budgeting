    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>Welcome to Offshore Budgeting, a privacy-first budgeting app. All data is processed on your device, and you will never be asked to connect a bank account. This guide introduces the core building blocks and explains exactly how totals are calculated across the app.</p>
<h2>The Building Blocks</h2>
<p>Cards, Income, Expense Categories, Presets, and Budgets are the foundation:</p>
<ul><li>Cards hold your expenses and let you analyze spending by card.</li><li>Income is tracked as planned or actual. Planned income helps you forecast savings, while actual income powers real savings calculations.</li><li>Expense Categories describe what an expense was for, like groceries, rent, or fuel.</li><li>Presets are reusable planned expenses for recurring bills.</li><li>Variable expenses are one-off or unpredictable expenses tied to a card.</li><li>Budgets group a date range so the app can summarize income, expenses, and savings for that period.</li></ul>
<h2>Planned Expenses</h2>
<p>Expected or recurring costs for a budget period, like rent or subscriptions.</p>
<ul><li>Planned Amount: the amount you expect to debit from your account.</li><li>Actual Amount: if a planned expense costs more or less than expected, edit the planned expense and enter the actual amount.</li></ul>
<h2>Variable Expenses</h2>
<p>Unpredictable, one-off costs during a budget period, like fuel or dining. These are always treated as actual spending and are tracked by card and category.</p>
<h2>Planned Income</h2>
<p>Income you expect to receive, like salary or deposits. Planned income is used for forecasts and potential savings.</p>
<ul><li>Use planned income to help plan your budget. If income is very consistent, consider recurring actual income instead.</li></ul>
<h2>Actual Income</h2>
<p>Income you actually receive. Actual income drives real totals, real savings, and the amount you can still spend safely.</p>
<ul><li>Income can be logged as actual when received, or set as recurring actual income for consistent paychecks.</li></ul>
<h2>Budgets</h2>
<p>Budgets are a lens for viewing your income and expenses over a specific date range. Create budgets that align with your financial goals and pay cycles.</p>
<h2>How Totals Are Calculated</h2>
<p>Everything in Offshore is basic math:</p>
<ul><li>Planned expenses total = sum of planned amounts for planned expenses in the budget period.</li><li>Actual planned expenses total = sum of actual amounts for those planned expenses.</li><li>Variable expenses total = sum of variable expenses in the budget period.</li><li>Planned income total = sum of income entries marked Planned in the period.</li><li>Actual income total = sum of income entries marked Actual in the period.</li><li>Potential savings = planned income total - planned expenses planned total.</li><li>Actual savings = actual income total - (planned expenses actual total + variable expenses total).</li></ul>
