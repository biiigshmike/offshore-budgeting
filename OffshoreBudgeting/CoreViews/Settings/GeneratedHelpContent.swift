This guide introduces the core building blocks and explains exactly how totals are calculated across the app. The Building Blocks Cards, Income, Expense Categories, Presets, and Budgets are the foundation: Cards hold your expenses and let you analyze spending by card. Income is tracked as planned or actual. Planned income helps you forecast savings, while actual income powers real savings calculations. Expense Categories describe what an expense was for, like groceries, rent, or fuel. Presets are reusable planned expenses for recurring bills. Variable expenses are one-off or unpredictable expenses tied to a card. Budgets group a date range so the app can summarize income, expenses, and savings for that period. Planned Expenses Expected or recurring costs for a budget period, like rent or subscriptions. Planned Amount: the amount you expect to debit from your account. Actual Amount: if a planned expense costs more or less than expected, edit the planned expense and enter the actual amount. Variable Expenses Unpredictable, one-off costs during a budget period, like fuel or dining. These are always treated as actual spending and are tracked by card and category. Planned Income Income you expect to receive, like salary or deposits. Planned income is used for forecasts and potential savings. Use planned income to help plan your budget. If income is very consistent, consider recurring actual income instead. Actual Income Income you actually receive. Actual income drives real totals, real savings, and the amount you can still spend safely. Income can be logged as actual when received, or set as recurring actual income for consistent paychecks. Budgets Budgets are a lens for viewing your income and expenses over a specific date range. Create budgets that align with your financial goals and pay cycles. How Totals Are Calculated Everything in Offshore is basic math: Planned expenses total = sum of planned amounts for planned expenses in the budget period. Actual planned expenses total = sum of actual amounts for those planned expenses. Variable expenses total = sum of variable expenses in the budget period. Planned income total = sum of income entries marked Planned in the period. Actual income total = sum of income entries marked Actual in the period. Potential savings = planned income total - planned expenses planned total. Actual savings = actual income total - (planned expenses actual total + variable expenses total)."
